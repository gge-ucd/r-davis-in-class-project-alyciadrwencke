#! is an anti or do not do this

#problem 1 - Take your hw2 vector and removed all the NAs then select all the numbers between 14 and 38 inclusive, call this vector prob1.

#problem 2 - Multiply each number in the prob1 vector by 3 to create a new vector called times3. Then add 10 to each number in your times3 vector to create a new vector called plus10.
times3 <- prob1 * 3 #multiplied the numbers in the vector by 3
times3

plus10 <- times3 + 10 #added 10 to each number in the vector of times 3
plus10

#vector math - understadning that when you tell R to do something, it will apply that to every number in the vector

#problem 3 - Select every other number in your plus10 vector by selecting the first number, not the second, the third, not the fourth, etc. If youâ€™ve worked through these three problems in order, you should now have a vector that is 12 numbers long that looks exactly like this one

#tab completion
#start typing the function and press tab, will prompt with some possible arguements that can be in the function
#does not work if the function is too general
